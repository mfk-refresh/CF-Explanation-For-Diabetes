# CF-Explanation-For-Diabetes

### Abstract
In the era of widespread machine learning
models, the opaque nature of their decision-making pro-
cesses poses significant risks, especially in critical domains
like healthcare. This paper aims to help people without
diabetes by informing them of potential ways to get diabetes
so that people can stay away from them. This study high-
lights the crucial need for Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) by presenting a pragmatic approach to generate
proximity-constrained counterfactuals for assessing dia-
betic risk. By synergistically combining the capabilities
of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations and
Diverse Counterfactual Explanations, our methodology fo-
cuses on perturbing the most influential features identified
by different AI explainers to reverse decisions while main-
taining proximity to the decision boundary. The resulting
counterfactuals offer actionable insights, enabling individ-
uals to actively manage lifestyle choices and potentially
reduce their diabetes risk. Our findings demonstrate the
effective implementation of this strategy, underscoring its
practicality and user-oriented decision-support capabilities.
It addresses constraints and integrates human assessments
for a more comprehensive evaluation. The proposed ap-
proach contributes to enhancing trust and transparency
in machine learning models for diabetic risk prediction
through interpretable and actionable counterfactual expla-
nations.
